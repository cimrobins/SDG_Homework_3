# AI's Role in Advancing Sustainable Development Goals: A Personal Reflection

## My Journey Understanding AI and Sustainability

When I first encountered the UN Sustainable Development Goals in an earlier course, they seemed like abstract aspirations—important, but difficult to translate into concrete action. Similarly, my understanding of AI was primarily theoretical. This project has fundamentally changed both perspectives for me.

I chose to focus on the retrofit versus demolish decision because buildings represent approximately 40% of global carbon emissions, yet these decisions are often made without a comprehensive sustainability framework. What I didn't realize when starting was how complex these decisions truly are—they involve balancing environmental concerns with economic realities and social impacts, exactly the kind of multi-dimensional problem where AI assistance could be valuable.

## Challenges and Insights from My Building Decision Support Project

My first challenge was simply understanding how to frame sustainability in concrete, actionable terms. The SDGs themselves are broad, and I initially struggled to translate them into specific criteria for building assessment. For SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), does preserving embodied carbon always outweigh operational efficiency? For SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), how do we balance historical preservation against creating more energy-efficient spaces?

I found that creating structured data was one of the most difficult aspects. While generating the data, I realized that sustainability isn't binary—there are genuine trade-offs between different SDGs. A building with asbestos might be better demolished from a health standpoint (supporting SDG 3) but retrofitting might better serve climate goals (SDG 13). AI doesn't eliminate these trade-offs, but it can help make them more transparent and ensure consistent consideration across multiple dimensions.

Another insight came from examining the model's outputs. When I first tested the model, it would sometimes generate recommendations that sounded plausible but didn't fully address all four SDGs. I realized that the value isn't just in the binary retrofit/demolish recommendation, but in the comprehensive explanation that considers multiple sustainability dimensions. The AI helps overcome the human tendency to focus on just one or two aspects of sustainability while neglecting others.

## Future Potential and Limitations

This project has shown me both the potential and limitations of AI in sustainable development. On the potential side, AI can:

1. **Operationalize abstract principles** - Translating high-level SDGs into specific, actionable recommendations helps bridge the gap between aspirations and implementation.
  
2. **Ensure consistent consideration** - Unlike humans who might focus on their areas of expertise, the model consistently evaluates all relevant SDGs for each decision.

3. **Scale expertise** - Once trained, the model can provide expert-level assessment for thousands of buildings, making sustainable decision-making more accessible.

4. **Integrate multiple perspectives** - The model forces consideration of social, environmental, and economic factors rather than siloing them.

However, I also encountered significant limitations:

1. **Data constraints** - The quality of AI recommendations is directly tied to the quality and comprehensiveness of training data, which is challenging for sustainability applications where real-world examples with SDG rationales don't readily exist.

2. **Context sensitivity** - What's sustainable in one region or climate might not be in another, making universal models difficult to create.

3. **Value judgments** - Many sustainability decisions ultimately involve value judgments about trade-offs that can't be purely algorithmic.

Through this project, I've come to see AI not as a replacement for human judgment in sustainability decisions, but as a tool to enhance and scale human expertise. The most effective approach seems to be using AI to provide comprehensive assessments across multiple SDGs, while keeping humans involved in the final decision-making process where values and context-specific factors can be considered.

This experience has transformed my understanding of both AI and sustainability. I now see how technical tools can help bridge the gap between abstract global goals and concrete local actions—a connection that's essential if we're going to address our most pressing environmental and social challenges.
